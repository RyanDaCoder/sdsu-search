  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
        1   WHEN IS THE PROMISE DEADLINE?
            Two (2) weeks after the start of the semester. The semester deadlines are listed on the
            mycollegepromise.net website.

        2   HOW ARE TUITION AND FEES PAID THROUGH THE PROMISE?
            After registering for classes, there are two (2) ways the Promise can pay your tuition and
            mandatory fees.
               OPTION 1: Do NOT PAY at the time of registration.
               Tuition and mandatory fees will be paid for by the Promise, after the deadline. Students can
               attend classes and will not be dropped for nonpayment.
               OPTION 2: PAY at the time of registration.
               Tuition and mandatory fees will be automatically reimbursed, after the deadline.

        3   WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROMISE?
            Students who are CA residents or AB540 are eligible. The Grossmont-Cuyamaca College Promise is
            not just for recent high school graduates. There is no age limitation.

        4   IS THE PROMISE ELIGIBILITY DETERMINED BY INCOME?
            No. Students must complete a Financial Aid Application (FAFSA or Dream Act), but do not have to
            qualify for Financial Aid to be eligible to receive the Promise.

        5   DOES THE PROMISE PAY FOR SUMMER CLASSES?
            No. However, grades from Summer classes will count towards maintaining a cumulative 2.0 GPA
            requirement.

        6   CAN STUDENTS START IN THE SPRING AND RECEIVE THE PROMISE?
            Yes, and if eligibility requirements are maintained, they would be eligible for the following Fall and
            Spring semesters (2nd year).

        7   WHEN ARE STUDENTS NOTIFIED 7 IF THEY ARE AWARDED?
            Two weeks after the semester deadline, via email.

            HOW DO I CONTINUE TO REMAIN ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE PROMISE EACH SEMESTER?
        8   Students must (1) maintain full-time (12-units, or reduced units for students approved for disability

n Do you know you may be eligible to have your fees waived?
  Many students are eligible to have their fees waived but they don’t apply.
  The easiest way to qualify for a fee waiver is to complete the Free Application for Federal
  Student Aid (FAFSA).
  You can fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) online at
  https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa.
  By completing the FAFSA you will also be considered for all of the financial aid programs at
  Grossmont College including the fee waiver.
  You can also apply for the fee waiver by going online to
  https://www.grossmont.edu/financial-aid/grants/california-college-promise-grant.php
  and select “online fee waiver application.”
  If you are eligible for a fee waiver, you may be eligible for a refund of the fees you have
  already paid. It’s a free application no matter which way you choose to apply.

n Easy Payment Options
  Master Card, VISA, Discover, American Express, check or money order.
  Students are responsible for all appropriate fees and are dropped from classes for non-
  payment of fees.
